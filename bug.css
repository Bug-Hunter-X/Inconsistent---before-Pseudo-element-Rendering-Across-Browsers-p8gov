The following CSS code has an uncommon error: it uses a selector that's valid in some browsers but not others, leading to inconsistent rendering.

```css
.my-element::before { content: '!'; }
```

The `::before` pseudo-element is used to insert content before an element. While widely supported, older or less common browsers might not render this correctly.  Inconsistent rendering across browsers is a common problem here.
